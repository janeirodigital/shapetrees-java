# shapetrees-java-client-core

shapetrees-java-client-core includes an interface, `ShapeTreeClient`
which is a proposed API to abstract the HTTP protocol used by
shape trees.

It is recommended that this interface be used by any implementations of 
a client interacting with shape trees.

For a sample implementation see [shapetrees-java-client-okttp](../shapetrees-java-okhttp/README.md).
